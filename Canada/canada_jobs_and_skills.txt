                        3) Job : - Amazon Backend Developer
                        
                            Skills Required :-

-> Programming Knowledge: -

    familiarity with a prominent language is generally a prerequisite for success. You
should be familiar with the syntax of languages such as Java, Python, C#, C/C++, or
Ruby. You should also know some of the languages’ nuances, such as how memory
management works, or the most commonly used collections, libraries, etc.

-> Data Structures:-

    Most of the work we do involves storing and providing access to data in efficient
ways. This requires a strong background in data structures. You’ll need to understand
the inner workings of common data structures and be able to compare and contrast
their usage in various applications.

-> Algorithms:-

    our interview will not be focused on rote memorization of algorithms. However,
having a good understanding of the most common algorithms will likely make
solving some of the questions a lot easier. Consider reviewing common algorithms
such as traversals, divide and conquer, breadth-first search vs. depth-first search and
understand the tradeoffs for each.

-> Coding:-

    If you feel a bit rusty coding without an IDE or coding in a specific language,    it’s a good idea to dust off the cobwebs and get comfortable coding with a pen and paper.
The most important thing a Software Development Engineer does at Amazon is write
scalable, robust, and well-tested code. These are the main evaluation criteria for your
code. Make sure that you check for edge cases and validate that no bad input can slip
through. This is your chance to show off your coding ability.

-> Object Oriented Design:-

    Good design is paramount to extensible, bug-free, long-lived code. We know
it’s possible to solve any given software problem in almost limitless ways, but
when software needs to be extensible and maintainable, good softwaredesign is critical to success. One way to build lasting software is to use
object-oriented design best practices. You should have a working knowledge
of a few common and useful design patterns, along with how to write software
in an object-oriented way.

-> Databases :-

    Many of the challenges tech people face arise when figuring out how to most
efficiently retrieve and store data for future use. Amazon has been at the
forefront of the non-relational DB movement. We have made Amazon Web
Services such as DynamoDB available to the developer community so that
they can easily leverage the benefits of non-relational databases. While we
don't expect any particular level of expertise with non-relational databases,
you should be familiar with broad database concepts and their applications.

-> Operating Systems:-
    
    You won’t need to know how to build your own operating system from
scratch, but you should be familiar with some OS topic that can affect code
performance (e.g. memory management, processes, threads,
synchronization, paging, and multithreading).

->General machine learning and artificial learning: -

    Expect to be asked about data-driven modeling, train/test protocols, error
analysis, and statistical significance. For example, given a problem definition,
you should be able to formulate it as a machine learning problem and
propose a solution, including ideas for data sources, annotation, modeling
approaches, and potential pitfalls. Understand the basic AI/ML methods and
algorithms – revisit your favorite ML and AI textbooks.
